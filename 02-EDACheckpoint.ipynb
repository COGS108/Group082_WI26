    "Our ethics discussion from the proposal stage remains relevant, and we extend it here with observations grounded in the actual data we have wrangled and explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data collection and representation bias\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inside Airbnb dataset captures only listings that were *active and publicly visible* on Airbnb at the time of scraping. This creates a systematic **survivorship bias**: listings that have been deactivated, suspended, or voluntarily removed are not present in our data. Hosts who have exited the platform — potentially due to low demand, poor reviews, or local regulation — are invisible to our analysis. Our findings therefore describe the characteristics of *currently active* listings, not the full universe of San Diego short-term rentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the geographic distribution of listings in our dataset is uneven. Coastal neighborhoods (La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, Coronado) are heavily represented, while inland and lower-income neighborhoods have comparatively fewer listings. This means our model's performance and interpretations may generalize less well to underrepresented areas of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighbourhood as a proxy variable\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our core predictors — neighbourhood or ZIP code — is a geographic variable that, in the context of San Diego, carries substantial demographic and socioeconomic meaning. Neighbourhoods in San Diego correlate with race and income due to historical patterns of residential segregation and redlining. When our model uses neighbourhood as a predictor of price, it is not capturing \"location\" in a purely physical sense; it is also encoding information about the social composition of the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not claim that our model discriminates by race or income — we have no such variables in our dataset. But we acknowledge that neighbourhood-based price predictions could, in practice, function as proxies for protected attributes. Any downstream use of our model (e.g., to guide pricing decisions) should account for this limitation explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review score bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Our EDA includes review scores as a predictor variable. Review scores are generated only by guests who have booked and chosen to leave a review, which is a non-random subset of all guests. Guests who had very negative experiences may be less likely to write a review (preferring to simply not return), or conversely, more likely to write a negative one. This uncertainty means that review scores are not a neutral measure of quality — they reflect the opinions of a self-selected subset of guests, mediated by price expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform-level bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb's search algorithm, pricing suggestions, and promotional features are not neutral. Listings that appear higher in search results may command higher prices not because of their intrinsic characteristics, but because of platform-mediated visibility advantages. Our dataset does not include information about listing visibility or algorithmic promotion, so we cannot account for this source of variation. Our findings should be understood as describing associations within the platform-visible listing pool, not as capturing the full causal structure of Airbnb pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Honest representation and scope of conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout our EDA and modeling, we commit to representing our findings honestly. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We do not make causal claims. All associations reported are correlational, derived from observational cross-sectional data.\n",
    "- We acknowledge that our cleaned dataset excludes extreme outliers, which means our model may not generalize well to very high-end luxury listings or unusually cheap listings.\n",
    "- We use median rather than mean prices where distributions are skewed, to avoid misleading readers about typical price levels.\n",
    "- Our results describe pricing patterns on the Airbnb platform in San Diego as of the data collection date. They do not represent the full short-term or long-term rental market.\n",

During the EDA phase, \"tagging\" the next person in the workflow (e.g., Qifeng tagging Alina once data is cleaned) is required to maintain momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tone & Culture: We continue our \"blunt but polite\" feedback loop. Given that one person's analysis (e.g., visualization) will now be interpreted by another (e.g., narrative), we commit to open dialogue regarding how data is presented to ensure the \"story\" told in the text accurately reflects the \"data\" shown in the plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Making: Major project decisions (e.g., dropping a variable, changing a model) require a majority vote. For EDA, the Project Lead (Jing) has final say on the overall narrative structure to ensure rubric alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Assignment & Accountability: Tasks are assigned by EDA workflow stages (Wrangling -> Visualization -> Statistical Analysis -> Interpretation) and tracked via GitHub Issues. We have transitioned to this model to prevent unequal workload and ensure \"Excellent\" ratings for team participation. If a member cannot meet a deadline, they must notify the group 48 hours in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration Structure (New): We explicitly agree that \"the person who codes is not the sole person who writes.\" For every EDA section, the lead analyst must sync with the interpretation lead (Alina) to ensure the narrative provides the depth required by the COGS 108 rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflict Resolution: We assume positive intent and use private \"neutral ground\" discussions for conflicts. Consistent failure to meet expectations will lead to written notice and, if unresolved after one week, contact with the instructor."
